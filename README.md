# RoadUNet
A U-Net implementation in PyTorch, accelerated with CUDA, for segmenting autonomous driving images.

This work was used to present at the International Conference of Undergraduate Research 2024.

This code is not explained, commmented or readable in its current state due to being a fast paced project. I might come back to this and improve the notebook (unlikely).
